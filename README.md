# AarhusThroughTime

> AarhusThroughTime is an interactive shiny app that lets the user experience some very low risk time travel in the city of Aarhus, Denmark. The app shows the locations of a bunch of old photographic postcards from Aarhus, and lets the user "morph" between the postcard and a photo taken at the same place in 2021. A small (his)story about each location and some extra images are included.

> The postcards used in AarhusThroughTime are from the collection of BjÃ¸rn Eriksen which can be browsed [here](https://www.bjorneri.dk).

> The alignment of new photos to old postcards was done using the BigWarp function in BigDataViewer plugin for ImageJ (Fiji).
